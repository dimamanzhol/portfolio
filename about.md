# About Me

I'm a software engineer building sexy AI products.

At 18, I've been coding since 16 and designing since 15. I build things that shouldn't exist but do.

Currently building cool landing pages for companies solving real problems.

Previously: INO Center, TrueSpace (EdTech startup where 1,000+ business leaders from different countries learn to build with AI.
), Onai Agency
Studying: CS & AI at IITU

My philosophy: We don’t believe in interfaces.
We believe in moments where AI understands you before you explain,
where design removes every obstacle between thought and action,
and where interaction feels less like control
and more like collaboration.
The best interface is invisible — because the best products think with you.

Based in Almaty, Kazakhstan.
